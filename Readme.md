# vigil@nte

A turn-based melee combat roguelike.

## How to play

You are Atman (@-man), a masked vigilante trained in martial arts, who is trying to descend into the lair of the crime kingpin Mr. Yendor. You must use your four moves—dodge, punch, stun, and counter—to defeat all the henchmen on each level.

**Controls**

You do everything with the mouse. There are four controls: left and right click with no modifiers, and left and right click with Shift or Alt held down.

- Left click: Wait, Walk/Dodge, Punch
- Right click: Counter
- Shift/Alt+Right click: Stun
- Shift/Alt+Left click: Unused

**Moves**

- Wait: do nothing
- Walk/Dodge: Move out of the way of most attacks. Attacks by red enemies ("Titan Thugs") are harder to dodge.
- Punch: Do damage to an enemy and stun them for 1 turn. Does not affect yellow enemies at all ("Armored Thugs") and does not stun red enemies.
- Counter: If an enemy is about to punch, grab their arm and swap places with them, throwing them to the ground. Red enemies cannot be countered.
- Stun: Stuns an enemy for 1 turn (blue) or 2 turns (yellow). Yellow enemies can only take damage while stunned.
